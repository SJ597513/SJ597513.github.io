Recent PhD in Mechanical Engineering (UIC) whose research develops EMG-based human-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization and impedance-based control to personalize hip-exoskeleton assistance. My work couples machine-learning initialization and heteroscedastic Bayesian models to reduce muscle activity and perceived exertion while delivering clinically feasible tuning times. Iâ€™m actively open to postdoctoral positions and industry roles in ML engineering or data science that translate research into robust, user-centric systems.
